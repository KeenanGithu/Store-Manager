-If we're basing any of my programs off of my current skill, I recommend to use this one. While the other ones were updated recently, the main code for them was

-There are some ugly-looking print statements, but each are explained with comments beforehand.
-A variation of SMAPE is used to calculate how much a customer wants a product
